Privacy and Model Protection \nTo mitigate the risk of recovering the training data from the trained model, \nwhich is also commonly known as reverse engineering or model inversion, \nwe provide a configurable client-side privacy control based on the differential-privacy (DP) technique. \nDuring training, each client could have their own privacy policy and could be updated by the admin client during training. \n\nThe DP protection consists of two major components: selective parameter update and sparse vector technique (SVT):\nFor selective parameter update, the client only sends a partial of the model weights/updates, \ninstead of the whole, to limit the amount of information shared. \nThis is achieved by:\n1. only uploading the fraction of the model weights/updates whose absolute values are greater than a predefined threshold or percentile of the absolute update values; \n2. further replacing the model weights by clipping its value to a fixed range. \nSparse vector technique operates on a random fraction of the weights/updates x by first adding a random noise to its absolute value abs(x)+Lap(s); \nthen share the clipped noisy value clip(x+Lap(s), ) iff the thresholding condition is satisfied. \nHere abs(x) represents absolute value, Lap(x) denotes a random valuable sampled from the Laplace distribution, \nis a pre-defined threshold, clip(x,) denotes clipping of x value to be in the range of [-,]. \n\nFor detail, please refer to [W, Li. et, al “Privacy-preserving Federated Brain Tumour Segmentation”,  arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.00962 (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00962)\nThe experimental results show that there is a tradeoff between model performance and privacy protection costs.\n",

Security \nAs you might have noticed from this notebook there are couple of security issues with the current setup.\n\n# 4.1 Disallow BYOC  \nFirst issues is BYOC code is pushed by admin in the custom folder to all clients. \nThis is potential threat as admin could write any malicious code to run on the client.\n\nThe solution to this is to rule groups. \nThere you can set `BYOC` and/or `allow custom datalist` to false.\nThis will disallow uploading the custom folder of the mmar. \nIf research lead tries to do this he would get error \n```\nError: Authorization Error: the MMAR contains custom code, which is not allowed on site \"org1-a\" and reject any uploads\n``` \nYou can test this by starting client3 which has this strict rule and try to upload the mmar.\n\nFor clients how are more strict the workflow should be:\n1. Lead researched send custom folder to client via email.\n2. Client review the code and verify it is not doing any harm\n3. Client should place custom code in `/local/custom` \n\n# 4.2 Roles and Rights\nAll experiments till now, we have logged in as super user `admin@admin.com` who has all rights to de everything. \nYou should now try to log in with restricted user who have limited action.\n\nin the admin terminal you should: \n1. `cd project1/leadIT/startup`\n2. `./fl_admin.sh`\n3. log in as `leadIT@org1.com`\n   \nIn the admin terminal you should: \n1. `cd project1/leadIT/startup`\n2. `./fl_admin.sh`\n3. log in as `siteresearcher@org2.com`\n\n# 4.3 Disallow all Roles and Rights\nIn some extreme cases some clients would want to have the only access to their client that is lead researcher is not allowed to upload any mmar files. \nThis guaranties total security, however this would add the constant communication overhead with every run to move mmars into a run folder. \n\nNever the less this option is provided by steps below (see image):\n1. creating an new rights group (for Example: `only4secure`)\n2. Make sure other groups don\u0027t have any access\n3. Give access to  self deploy and train for this group\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src\u003d\"screenShots/Authorization4Sevure.png\" alt\u003d\"Drawing\" style\u003d\"height: 300px;\"/\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn our Example, we have set up `client4` to be super secure with the only user allowed to upload is user `leadIT@secure.com`\n\nTo test this actually works:\n1. cd to client4 and start the client\n    1. `cd /claraDevDay/FL/project1/client4/startup`\n    2. `./start.sh`\n2. cd to leadIT and log in\n    In the admin terminal you should: \n    1. `cd project1/leadIT/startup`\n    2. `./fl_admin.sh`\n    3. log in as `leadIT@secure.com`\n3. try to upload mmar to client4 using `\u003e deploy adminMMAR client client4` \n4. You should get message below \n```\nError: Authorization Error: you are not authorized to deploy MMAR to \"client4\"\nDone [15666 usecs] 2020-10-26 18:55:39.807613\n```\n",
